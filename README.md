Fuzzy prolog project that analyses philosophers and some of their characteristics

The model is not really big, so most conclusions may be slanted. The idea of the project was learning fuzzy prolog and having some fun with it.

There is an interactive demo in www.uflese.com (philosophers.pl database).
